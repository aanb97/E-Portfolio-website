       <h1>Research Proposal on AI for Physically Disabled and Elderly</h1>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This unit helped me to know both exploratory and descriptive research designs, in addition to the significance of mixed-methods research tools and approaches: quantitative and qualitative. I drafted a research proposal on “Using AI to assist physically disabled and elderly individuals.”</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>To opt for such mixed methods as a research design and collect the data accordingly was enormously useful. The research topic I selected needed this method, as it was useful to collect both quantitative data on AI efficacy and qualitative insights into user experiences.</p>
