            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Through this unit, I was able to explore the scientific methods used in academic research and the ethical considerations to follow meticulously as an academic and professional researcher. I was able to differentiate the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning, besides knowing the significance of ethical issues in my domain of research.</p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Understanding the key role of the scientific method in having a proper structure for the research was enormously important. Research ethics, especially in AI research, are significant for making sure AI is used responsibly and no harm is committed.</p>
