            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>Through this unit, I learned how ethical issues can be encountered in the process of data collection and how significant the ethical dimensions are in conducting research. The case study of The Cambridge Analytica scandal was useful throughout, whereas I assessed the ethical implications of such practices.</p>
