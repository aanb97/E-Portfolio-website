      <h2>ABOUT</h2><br>
		
		<p class="p1">This e-portfolio showcases my learning and development from the RMPP module. This e-portfolio encompasses my reflective activities, statistical exercises, literature review assessments, and personal reflections on diverse aspects of my learning and development throughout this module. The structure of this e-portfolio is comprehensive, highlighting key artifacts from all the units to ensure a holistic view of what I have learned and achieved via this journey. <br> <br>
			In this entire module, I had to carry out a host of activities and academic exercises meant to build a stronger basis in the theoretical and practical aspects of Research. The reflective activities provided me the opportunity to closely assess my all-out experience as well as identify the domains of my strengths and opportunities through which I can grow personally and academically. Through this module, such reflections gave me deep insights into the processes of learning, which in turn helped me connect the theoretical concepts with real-world applications. <br> <br>
			The exercises for the statistics subject proved immensely meaningful, which enhanced my skillset for data analysis. With diverse data sets and tools, I could develop a stronger understanding of interpreting and presenting the data in an effective and readable manner. Such exercises built my technical capabilities while underscoring the significance of accurate and precise handling of data. <br> <br>
			A critical review of the present literature was yet another important part of learning through this module. Through such exercises, I was able to learn how to carry out literature reviews, synthesize the key findings of each research paper, and craft an on-point, critical, and evidence-based narrative review. <br> <br>
			Personal reflections on my learning journey have been integral to this e-portfolio. Such reflections provided me with the ability to assess my progress, set learning milestones, and know my professional aspirations. These reflections have also helped to instill critical thinking in me throughout the module. <br> <br>
			this e-portfolio covers my growth professionally and academically and hence dives into what I have achieved via this module, which illustrates the extent of my learning experiences in the Computing Professional module.</p>
